Presently there are many [GPU vendors](https://www.jonpeddie.com/reports/market-watch/)
available in the market for GPU architecture, in particular,
AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. But Nvidia shares a large percentage.
Therefore, we focus on GPU programming for Nvidia.
Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a programming language that uses to program the Nvidia GPUs.

### Why learning GPU programming:

* Each and every year supercomputers computational power is increasing.
* [The topmost 10 supercomputers have GPU as accelerators](https://www.top500.org/).
* To be able to use available resources from the hardware side, we should be 
able to run our scientific codes on parallel architecture.

### Things you will learn from this course:

* GPU architecture (memory hierarchy, streaming multiprocessor, TPU, etc.).
* GPU parallel programming (thread organization and CUDA).
* GPU programming for computational numerical linear algebra.
* Applications (machine learning, bioinformatics, physics, and computational fluid dynamics).
* Code optimization (fine-tuning and profiling technique).
